Skin is actually our body’s largest organ by size. Since your skin plays such an important role in protecting your body, we should keep it as healthy as we can. This will help you keep from getting sick or having damage to your bones, muscles, and internal organs. Different seasons may wreak serious havoc on your skin. The threat of sunburn from extreme summer sun will subside to give way to the threat of chapped lips and flaky skin from the extreme cold weather in the wintery season. This cycle of threats from different seasons underscores the importance of skin health all year round, making it a significant public health problem in today’s society. And we are in the times of COVID-19 where people can't go to the hospitals because it is almost full and not to mention the fear of catching the disease
This application is not only build for awareness but could be used for education purposes so that people could know about these diseases prevent them from happening thus saving a lot of lives.

## What it does
Gloww website predicts the type of skin diseases and provide the result as a possibility. It acts as a one stop solution where people can find the result without waiting in long queue for the result and it also has extended features where you can interact with doctors with any delay and can find solutions to be cured before any fatality happens.

## How I built it
For the machine learning model i used google cloud automl which I customized different models to find the best accuracy. I also used cloud run . I also used Docker as my container to run the project on localhost and has deployed it onto Docker hub as a public repo so to access in a easier way. I used Streamlit as my frontend and deployed it on streamlit. I used Python, Machine learning model, Docker, Jitsi Api for interaction with doctors. And finally Flask framework to connect the website with our model.

## Challenges I ran into
 I tried my best to train the model, it was tough to gain the highest accuracy but it has given me around 98%. To train and deploy the model was kind of a new challenge for me. I am very new to Docker and containers and I was a bit of curious to use it :)

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Being totally new to Hackathons, the implementation of the entire project helped me realize the importance of collaboration and the dynamics of working in a project . In every Hackathon, proper time management plays a crucial role that can become a determining factor for the overall progress; I understood the instrumentality of following the code of conduct and treating fellow developers with respect while learning and improving through their feedback. I also got to learn much about container such as docker and how to deploy the images in docker and push it to Docker hub.

## What I learned
I learnt a lot about web development and hosting a site while working on my project, it definitely was a great learning experience.  I also learned about how contributing to open source community is a perk for my future challenges and how it would help people in a greater way. The whole training and implementing the model was new and I had fun exploring it.

## What's next for Gloww
I want to improve my models accuracy and achieve the best result I can. I would now work on my version 2 which would filter the present diseases to more classification which would further help people to identify which disease and the type of that particular diseases. I will work with other diseases and make it an online diagnosis for multiple diseases. I would also make it to Android ,IOS support and also to Kai OS so that everyone can access with ease.

##What is the effect your project will have on students returning to in person school?
This project is not only for people who have the diseases but could also be used for creating awareness and educate people on how to prevent these diseases and help them to educate other as well.
